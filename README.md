# Multiplying Numbers by 2 with Machine Learning
## Inspiration
Human inaccuracies faced by students when using outdated forms of computation (calculators).
## What it does
Our project multiples all numbers in a provided range by 2 using a machine learning algorithm to provide a highly accurate answer.
## How we built it
We built it by creating a Python script.
## Challenges we ran into
A challenge we ran into was improper use of linear regression.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We accomplished successfully creating and running our project.
## What we learned
We learned when to use and when not to use linear regression.
## What's next for Multiplying Numbers By 2 with Machine Learning
Although we believe the project is mostly finished, we may implement methods to multiple a range of numbers with numbers that are not exclusively 2.
